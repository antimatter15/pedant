## wat

If you're reading this, the project probably seems shrouded in an impenetrable veil of mystery. If it isn't, then you probably don't want to read this section because it's written with the working assumption that the reader is absolutely clueless about the nature of this project. In these projects, I seek to instill a sense of the vision which inspired me to create this, and of course that's absolutely untrue. I'm writing this at a time when I have invested considerable resources (monetarily) into this project without any concrete vision of what it is or should become.

I'm just as confused about this as you probably are at this point, but that's okay, because we can beat this thing together. But as I ramble on for a few more sentences in this state of ignorance, stay with me (or leave, but then I'll hate you, not that there's any way for me to find out), because maybe at the end, I'll be able to describe what exactly this thing is, where I'm coming from (conceptually) and where it's headed.

### Stealing memories from the future

I played around with this idea in some random college proto-essay, but really I have to say it's inspired by a [dresden codak strip](http://dresdencodak.com/2006/01/30/epilogue/). In the revisionist scheme of organizing my accomplishments (in an uber-narcissistic way of course), one of those guiding themes of sorts about my life is futurism, and since I have to inject myself somewhere on the scene, my role in particular of bringing the course of the future into reality.

I have a vision for the future, but in terms of scale, it's much more narrow than the long term futurists. I pick and choose things which are cool and pay attention to them. I passively observe trends, and eventually past some magical threshold point, I feel I have a pretty good idea of how the future should look like (if not how it will look like). 

In that revisionist scheme of things, I can categorize many of my projects by their respective inspirations in accordance to this mystical trend:

* [CloudFall](http://antimatter15.com/wp/2012/07/cloudfall-a-text-editor/), [Ajax Animator](http://antimatter15.com/wp/ajax-animator/), [HTML5 MP3 Player](http://antimatter15.com/wp/2011/03/mp3-player/), etc. - A great deal of what I do happens to be web apps, and while blindly operating in accordance to [Atwood's Law](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/07/the-principle-of-least-power.html) isn't terribly innovative or prescient, these projects did exactly that. They're traditionally desktop applications which were uprooted (in a sense) and made into web applications which operate with some small subset of functionality (albeit in a somewhat impressive manner)
* [Project Wikify](http://wikify.antimatter15.com/) - This project didn't quite have a desktop analogue, so it's more firmly some idea which embraces the idea of the web. In fact, it's more of a retrofitting of the web platform with a vestigial feature of sorts. The original web, of Tim Berners-Lee at CERN was very much Read-Write, but in the forward march to centralization and online growth, this has more or less fallen away. Wikify brought this sense of an open communal canvas back by allowing anyone to in essence fork the likeness of any page, to update, comment, annotate, parody or otherwise add value to the content. It's hard to imagine that the future of knowledge would ever become more closed.
* [ShinyTouch](http://antimatter15.com/wp/2009/08/shinytouch-videos/) - Touchscreens are awesome, they're awesome. The project started shortly afterward the emergence of the iPhone, and all I wanted was to have some Microsoft Surface type interface. Sure the touchscreen interaction on the iPhone was nice, but multitouch was always gimmicky on a mobile device. There were only a few instances where it might be forseeably useful to use more than one finger, and they were few and far between. But with the Microsoft Surface (which in mind is inextricably linked with the words ["Big Ass Table"](http://www.collegehumor.com/video/1180480/microsoft-surface-parody) as it's described in the excellent collegehumor parody). I saw large multitouch surfaces as the future and sought to speed up the process of reaching that future with some kind of novel retrofitting system.
* [Additive 3D](http://antimatter15.com/wp/category/3d/additive-3d-glasses/) - I walked out of Avatar in IMAX 3D and for the first time felt that 3D was actually a compelling addition to the visual experience. At the time the only type of home 3D systems were the ones which demanded shutter glasses (which were quite expensive). I then came up with the idea of Additive 3D glasses which in theory aren't quite as expensive as the subtractive (shutter) variety.
* [drag2up](http://antimatter15.com/wp/2010/10/drag2up-drag-files-onto-any-site/) - This one is more narrow in that it doesn't accomplish anything really "big", instead it looks into the future in a very short-term manner. The big new thing was drag and drop to upload, so why not extend that futuristic interaction paradigm to every website automatically through a browser extension.
* [Fluidizer](http://antimatter15.com/wp/2010/07/fluidizer-fixed-width-%E2%86%92-fluid-width-bookmarklet/) - Monitors are getting bigger and higher in resolution and designs meant for smaller screens no longer cut it. Press a button and magically use heuristics to adjust the layout without changing the design.
* [JS Distributed Computing](http://antimatter15.com/wp/2012/08/distributed-pi-revisited/) - I'm a fan of the projects like Folding@Home who use computation for the good of humanity, it's incredibly democratizing to think that it's possible to utilize these legions of personal computer users to accomplish something greater for humanity. The thing is that the pool for these services is still really limited, they're pilfering drops from an ocean of computation. But putting this kind of computation in the browser of some high profile site might be able to bring about some serious progress for humanity.  
* [Whammy](http://antimatter15.com/wp/2012/08/whammy-a-real-time-javascript-webm-encoder/) - There are lots of pretty cool graphics things and it would be pretty nice to be able to encode video in a browser and get rid of one of the last things which requires a server.

### What future is this?

The future that drives the vision of this project is one more traditionally long term. While it's technically one of the less complex, it goes to attack some of the concepts which drive visions of quite a ways off into the future. 

That future is the one with augmented reality, head up displays, nerve and cranial implants. The land of Google Glass, SixthSense, eyeTap and other projects kept in high regard.

But my project doesn't represent a "real" foray into the subject.
